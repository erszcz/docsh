searchNodes=[{"doc":"Welcome to docsh, a documentation engine for the Erlang shell. This project provides a number of helpers for accessing module and function doc comments, function specs and exported types. If you want your project to have embedded documentation, use rebar3_docsh plugin. If you want to browse some docs first, read on. To access this documentation you&#39;ve quite likely typed: h(docsh). h/{1,2,3} is the most generic invocation of docsh. h/1 prints documentation for a given module (as shown above) or function: h(fun lists:keyfind/3). h/{2,3} are limited to functions. h/2 displays information about all functions of the given name from a particular module, while h/3 also takes the expected function arity: h(proplists, get_value). h(proplists, get_value, 3). s/{1,2,3} is the helper to use if you&#39;re only interested in function specs, not their full documentation: s(fun proplists:get_value/3). s(proplists, get_value). s(proplists, get_value, 3). t/{2,3} is the helper for printing types exported from modules: t(gen_tcp, connect_option). t(gen_udp, socket). If you want to use the helpers in erl you&#39;ll be set up by docsh&#39;s install script. It will install a user_default module enabling the shell extensions. See https://github.com/erszcz/docsh/README.md if unsure about the installation steps or what user_default is. If you want to use docsh shell extensions in rebar3 shell, please refer to script/docsh_rebar3_shell.escript. If you want to call docsh as a library, please refer to docsh_erl.","ref":"docsh.html","title":"docsh","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh.html#activated/1","title":"docsh.activated/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh.html#load_shell_extensions/0","title":"docsh.load_shell_extensions/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh.html#main/1","title":"docsh.main/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh.html#version/0","title":"docsh.version/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh.html#t:external/0","title":"docsh.external/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html","title":"docsh_beam","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#abstract_code/1","title":"docsh_beam.abstract_code/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#attribute/2","title":"docsh_beam.attribute/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#beam_file/1","title":"docsh_beam.beam_file/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#docs/1","title":"docsh_beam.docs/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#from_beam_file/1","title":"docsh_beam.from_beam_file/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#from_loaded_module/1","title":"docsh_beam.from_loaded_module/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#name/1","title":"docsh_beam.name/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#source_file/1","title":"docsh_beam.source_file/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#source_file/2","title":"docsh_beam.source_file/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#t:debug_info/0","title":"docsh_beam.debug_info/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_beam.html#t:t/0","title":"docsh_beam.t/0","type":"opaque"},{"doc":"EEP-0048 (http://erlang.org/eeps/eep-0048.html) docs_v1 documentation format support.","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html","title":"docsh_docs_v1","type":"module"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for c::docsh_writer.from_internal/1.","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#from_internal/1","title":"docsh_docs_v1.from_internal/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for c::docsh_format.lookup/3.","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#lookup/3","title":"docsh_docs_v1.lookup/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#t:i18n_doc/0","title":"docsh_docs_v1.i18n_doc/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#t:item/0","title":"docsh_docs_v1.item/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#t:language/0","title":"docsh_docs_v1.language/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#t:string_/0","title":"docsh_docs_v1.string_/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_docs_v1.html#t:t/0","title":"docsh_docs_v1.t/0","type":"opaque"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc.html","title":"docsh_edoc","type":"module"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for c::docsh_reader.available/1.","ref":"docsh_edoc.html#available/1","title":"docsh_edoc.available/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc.html#format_edoc/2","title":"docsh_edoc.format_edoc/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for c::docsh_reader.to_internal/1.","ref":"docsh_edoc.html#to_internal/1","title":"docsh_edoc.to_internal/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc.html#to_internal/2","title":"docsh_edoc.to_internal/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html##element#/5","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.#element#/5","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html##root#/4","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.#root#/4","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html##text#/1","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.#text#/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html##xml-inheritance#/0","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.#xml-inheritance#/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html#format_edoc/2","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.format_edoc/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"#xmlElement.content as defined by xmerl.hrl.","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.html#t:xml_element_content/0","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl.xml_element_content/0","type":"type"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.html","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat","type":"module"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.html##element#/5","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.#element#/5","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.html##root#/4","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.#root#/4","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.html##text#/1","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.#text#/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.html##xml-inheritance#/0","title":"docsh_edoc_xmerl_flat.#xml-inheritance#/0","type":"function"},{"doc":"Documentation lookup functions exported in the Erlang shell.","ref":"docsh_erl.html","title":"docsh_erl","type":"module"},{"doc":"When invoked with a module as an argument like h(lists), then look up the module documentation.

Default dbg:dhandler/2 is nice, but when you want to use domain knowledge or discard some of the data (like too long arg lists / retvals) it might be convenient to write your own dbg handler function.
